#XML support
All settings which are available through the goat library, e.g. setting up the scene, can be made with help of a XML-file. This support is available within the library goat\_xml. It provides a class GOAT::XML::xmlReader for reading a XML-file. An overview on the structure of the file can be find in the [XML-Documentation](../../latex/xmldoc.pdf)  

This library is using Tiny-XML2 (detailed information about Tiny-XML2 can be found [here](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2)
