\#\+XML support All settings which are available through the goat library, e.\+g. setting up the scene, can be made with help of a XML-\/file. This support is available within the library goat\+\_\+xml. It provides a class \doxylink{class_g_o_a_t_1_1_x_m_l_1_1xml_reader}{GOAT\+::\+XML\+::xml\+Reader} for reading a XML-\/file. An overview on the structure of the file can be find in the \href{../../latex/xmldoc.pdf}{\texttt{XML-\/\+Documentation}} ~\newline


This library is using Tiny-\/\+XML2 (detailed information about Tiny-\/\+XML2 can be found \href{https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2}{\texttt{here}}
