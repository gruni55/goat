\label{struct_g_o_a_t_1_1raytracing_1_1grid_entry}\index{GOAT::raytracing::gridEntry@{GOAT::raytracing::gridEntry}}


Structure which holds all steps from the light source to the grid point In this structure every step is stored from the light source to the grid point and additonally the electric field at the grid point. For the electric field determination, only the Fresnel matrices, which describes the interaction between the ray and the object\textquotesingle{}s surface, will be considered This structure is needed within the ultrashort pulse calculation.
