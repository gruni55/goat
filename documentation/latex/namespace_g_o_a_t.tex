\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class represents a threedimensional (numeric) Matrix as Template. 

This class is used for the iray class. This class is intended for internal use only. It defines a plane, defined by a central position and two directional vectors.

This class represents an ellipsoid, defined by its half axis a, b and c according to the formula\+: $\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1$.

class which represents a box (cuboid). It is derived by class Object\+Shape ~\newline
 This class is mainly used for the octree calculation.

The Matrix class represents a template class for 3x3 numeric matrices. Operators for standard matrix operation are provided. This class is intended to work with the Vector template class defined in this S\+DK.

Abstract base class for all rays used for the raytracing process. This is the parent class, from which all ray classes are derived.
